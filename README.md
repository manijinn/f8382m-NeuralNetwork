My MNIST Neural Network.
I experimented with different techniques on a feed-forward neural network to achieve f1 scores that average to 99%. This was done using the information I learned from my machine learning course I took Fall 24'.
I opted to use a FFNN over a CNN for MNIST due to ease of implemtation.
